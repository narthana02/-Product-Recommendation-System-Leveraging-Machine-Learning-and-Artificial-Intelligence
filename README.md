# Product-Recommendation-System-Leveraging-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence
ABSTRACT:
The "Personalized Product Recommendation System" project seamlessly integrates 
predictive analytics methodologies, encompassing collaborative filtering, content-based 
filtering, and ensemble learning techniques, specifically employing Random Forest and 
decision tree algorithms. This comprehensive approach analyses user interactions and 
product characteristics, enabling the prediction of optimal product recommendations based 
on historical purchase data and user ratings. Emphasizing meticulous data pre-processing
for dataset cleanliness and transformation, the project utilizes collaborative filtering to 
identify analogous users and content-based filtering to tailor suggestions to individual 
preferences. The incorporation of ensemble learning, utilizing Random Forest, enhances 
prediction accuracy by amalgamating outputs from multiple decision trees. The decision 
tree algorithms play a pivotal role in predicting optimal product IDs, thereby refining 
recommendation precision based on user behavior.
Key performance metrics, including root mean squared error (RMSE) and precision-recall, 
serve as benchmarks to evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness. This project not only 
offers valuable insights into the efficiency of the recommendation system but also 
showcases advanced predictive analytics techniques that streamline the optimization of 
personalized product suggestions in a data-driven manner.
